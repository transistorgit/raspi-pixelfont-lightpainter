# raspi-pixelfont-lightpainter
Write lines of texts with some LEDs hooked up to a Raspberry Pi, as a light painting (long time photo exposure)

I wanted to build this up from scratch, together with my son.
There are already some very sophisticated lightpainting scripts out, but for clear understanding I think its 
best to reduce it to the basics: a pixel font array, a nested loop and a led switch command - thats all it needs
for writing some amazing words of light into the air.

I would be happy if you use it as a suggestion for own experiments with computers and electronics.

best regards
Bernd
